SQL Code for Google Case Study Challenge

Welcome Everyone, this will be my first SQL portfolio about Google Case Study Challenge 1: Cyclistic bike-share analysis using SQL to process and analyze the data.

You may open the SQLQuery.sql to view my SQL codes. 

Welcome for your enquiries and feedback.

I will be using R studio, Python and Tableau for more in-depth analysis. Stay tune for the link.
